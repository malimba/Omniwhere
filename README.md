# Omniwhere Technologies 🌐

**Your OS. Your Files. Anywhere. On Any Device.**

Omniwhere is a new way of thinking about computing. It’s not just remote access — it’s your **entire digital life**, portable and persistent, accessible from **any device** with a browser. Powered by a **UNIX-based operating system**, Omniwhere offers a seamless, secure experience whether you’re running natively or connecting remotely.

## 🧠 What is Omniwhere?

At its core, **Omniwhere is an operating system** — built from the ground up to support full remote control, synchronization, and system-level access across all your devices. The goal is to unify the computing experience, whether you’re on your phone, a friend’s laptop, or a smart terminal.

You can:
- Run **Omniwhere OS** locally as your **primary operating system**
- Install Omniwhere as a **system-level agent** on existing OSes (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- **Access your full setup from any browser** — no apps, no downloads
- **SSH or terminal into any connected machine** via a secure UI

## ✨ Key Features
- 🌍 Log in from any browser — no apps needed
- 🧠 Access your complete OS image, synced in real-time
- 🖥️ SSH into any of your devices via web UI
- 🔒 Built-in WebAuthn, 2FA, SSH, and encrypted tunnels
- 🧩 Extendable: run services and development tools within your cloud OS
- 💽 Omniwhere OS bootable ISO — run from USB, VM, or bare metal
- 🔄 Native agents for other operating systems to sync and integrate devices

## 🚀 Omniwhere OS (Alpha Planning)
A custom UNIX-based operating system optimized for:
- Remote session hosting and live sync
- Lightweight footprint and fast boot
- Cloud-native configuration and secrets syncing
- Real-time telemetry and remote command execution
- Modular architecture (can run headless or with custom UI)

## 🔧 Tech Stack (MVP)
- **Omniwhere OS** base (planned: Arch/Debian fork)
- Node.js / Go backend (WebSocket server, Auth)
- React + Tailwind frontend
- `xterm.js` for terminal emulation
- WebRTC + SSH tunnels for device control
- Golang/Rust lightweight agent for non-Omniwhere OS machines

## 🧪 Current Status
> Prototype in development. OS bootstrapping underway. Seeking collaborators with experience in:
- OS packaging and live ISO generation
- Low-level Linux development (init, service managers)
- P2P & WebRTC networking
- Security (SSH, sandboxing, WebAuthn)
- UI/UX design for cross-device terminal and session interaction

## 🧠 Long-Term Vision
Omniwhere OS is the **base layer** of a universal computing platform. Users should be able to:
- Carry their OS on a USB stick or run it in the cloud
- Sync all devices into one interface — secure, fast, elegant
- Build or deploy tools directly inside their persistent environment
- Own and control their digital footprint entirely — from the terminal to the cloud
